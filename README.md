# pyQuEST

A Python interface for the Quantum Exact Simulation Toolkit (QuEST) written mainly in Cython.

## Getting started
After cloning the repository

```console
$ git clone -b develop --recursive --shallow-submodules https://github.com/rrmeister/pyQuEST
```

it is recommended to create a virtual environment, e.g. with `venv`, we'll call it `quantum-playground`.

```console
$ python3 -m venv quantum-playground
$ source quantum-playground/bin/activate
```

> By default, pyQuEST will use double precision for its floating point variables, have multithreading enabled, but GPU acceleration and distributed computing disabled. These settings can be changed in the dictionary `quest_config` at the top of `setup.py` *before* compiling and installing the package.

After setting the compile options as required, the package can be compiled and installed using `pip3`.

```console
$ pip3 install ./pyQuEST
```

> For this last step — depending on your system — you might have to separately install the Python development headers, usually called `python3-dev` or `python3-devel`. Check your distribution for details if the installer cannot find `Python.h`.

## Usage
After successful installation, we can start a Python interpreter — with e.g. `ipython` or `python3` — and import pyQuEST to have a look at the environment it is running in.
> Make sure to not launch your interpreter from within the `pyQuEST` folder, as the `pyquest` source directory would take precedence over the installed package and cause the import to fail.

```python
In [1]: import pyquest

In [2]: pyquest.env
Out[2]: QuESTEnvironment(cuda=False, openmp=False, mpi=False, num_threads=1, num_ranks=1, precision=2)
```
The `QuESTEnvironment` class is automatically instantiated once upon module import and never needs to be called by the user. It contains internals and can return information about the execution environment, as above. If you changed the options in `setup.py`, make sure these are reflected in this output. If they are not, this indicates a problem during compiling.

### Example
The most important classes are `Register` representing a quantum register, and the operators which can be applied to it. Let's create such a register with 3 qubits and look at its contents.

```python
In [3]: from pyquest import Register

In [4]: from pyquest.unitaries import *

In [5]: reg = Register(3)

In [6]: reg[:]
Out[6]: array([1.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j])
```

Like in QuEST, the state is automatically initialised to the all-zero product state. To apply some gates to it, first import some unitaries and the `Circuit` class.

```python
In [7]: from pyquest.unitaries import H, X, Ry

In [8]: from pyquest import Circuit
```

The operators are constructed from their classes with their target qubits, then any additional parameters (like a rotation angle), and then the control qubits as a keyword-only argument, e.g. `Ry(0, .2, controls=[1])` creates a rotation operator about the y-axis of the Bloch sphere by 0.2 radians on qubit 0, controlled by qubit 1. A single operator can be applied to a register `reg` with `reg.apply_operator(X(1))`. To apply multiple operators at once, first collect them into a `Circuit`.

```python
In [9]: circ = Circuit([H(0), X(2, controls=[0]), Ry(1, .23, controls=[2])])

In [10]: reg.apply_circuit(circ)

In [11]: reg[:]
Out[11]:
array([0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j,
       0.        +0.j, 0.70243619+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.08113816+0.j])
```

Multiplying two registers together will return their inner product. For example, the expectation value of `X(1)` is

```python
In [12]: temp = Register(copy_reg=reg)

In [13]: temp.apply_operator(X(1))

In [14]: reg * temp
Out[14]: (0.11398876176759418+0j)
```

A measurement can be performed with

```python
In [15]: from pyquest.gates import M

In [16]: reg.apply_operator(M(1))
Out[16]: [0]
```

Remember that measurements are destructive.

```python
In [17]: reg[:]
Out[17]:
array([0.70944592+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j,
       0.        +0.j, 0.70475988+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j])
```

A register can also be directly modified, but may then end up in an invalid state if not properly normalised.
```python
In [18]: reg[:] = 0

In [19]: reg[:]
Out[19]: array([0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j])

In [20]: reg[4] = 1j

In [21]: reg[:]
Out[21]: array([0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+1.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j])
```

For further details on which operators are available and all methods of `Register` and `Circuit`, for now check out the documentation in the source files.

## Development
If you want to contribute to the project or just play around with the source, you can use an editable install

```console
$ pip3 install -e .
```

but this temporarily re-installs the build requirements every time the project is compiled and clutters the `pyquest` source directory with build artifacts. It is therefore a good idea to simply install the build requirements manually

```console
$ pip3 install -r build_requirements.txt
```

and then call

```console
$ python3 setup.py build
```

to build pyQuEST in the `_skbuild/<os_id>/cmake-install/pyquest` folder, or use

```console
$ python3 setup.py install
```
to install the package without telling `pip` about it. This is really only recommended in a virtual environment.
